# whatsapp_automatic_message
This Python script automates sending pre-defined WhatsApp messages to multiple contacts using "pywhatkit" package. It calculates the next available time slot and sends messages sequentially to each contact, ensuring a delay between each message. The script runs through WhatsApp Web, allowing seamless automated messaging once you log in via QR code.
